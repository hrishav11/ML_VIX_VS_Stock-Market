Volatility Index -->a market index that serves as a key measure of the stock market's expected volatility fear gauge" or "fear index" because it reflects investors' expectations of future market risk and turbulence.
NASDQ -->It is particularly known for its heavy focus on the technology sector and is considered a key benchmark for U.S. large-cap growth stocks The NASDAQ-100 is a stock market index composed of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

FOR BASIC UNDERSTANDING

VIX --> market fear/uncertainty index for the US stock market

High VIX → market expects big moves (often in a crisis, lots of fear).

Low VIX → market expects calm, smaller moves.

It can be inferred from this graph that while Nasdaq’s daily log returns oscillate around zero with many random positive excursions, VIX returns manifest themselves with more sustained cycles interspersed with abrupt peaks at times of intense market stress episodes. Most notably, these periods of major VIX excursions—2001 dot-com bubble burst, 2008 global financial crisis, 2011 debt-ceiling crisis episode, 2020 COVID panic crash, and 2022 inflation scare—are exactly when huge adverse Nasdaq market returns manifest themselves. Concomitant with this indication of an established inverse link between market fear (suggested by high VIX) and stock market activity (manifested by more extreme and heightened volatile market excursions of Nasdaq), while lack of daily pair correlation can easily be inferred visually from this graph: periods of extreme VIX excursions display intense association with major market sell-offs and therefore can reliably function as an indicator not of market outcomes but rather market stress episodes themselves.
